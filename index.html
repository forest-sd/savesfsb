<section class="hero"><div class="container"><h1>Support Local. Shop Unique.</h1><p>San Francisco's small businesses are the heartbeat of our city. They create jobs, foster innovation, and contribute to the unique culture of our neighborhoods.</p><a href="/about/" class="btn">Get Involved</a></div></section><section><div class="container"><h2>Why Small Businesses Matter</h2><p>Small businesses account for over 90% of San Francisco's businesses and employ hundreds of thousands of residents. They define the character of neighborhoods — from the bakeries of the Sunset to the bookshops of North Beach to the boutiques of Hayes Valley. When small businesses close, neighborhoods lose their identity, foot traffic declines, and commercial corridors become dominated by chains and vacancies.</p><div class="grid"><div class="card"><h3>Shop Local</h3><p>Make a commitment to shop at local businesses whenever possible. Every dollar spent locally circulates through the community.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>Spread the Word</h3><p>Share your favorite small businesses on social media. Word of mouth is the most powerful marketing tool local businesses have.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>Get Involved</h3><p>Volunteer, attend local business events, and advocate for policies that support small business owners.</p></div></div></div></section>
